# Gradle + Java - Quickstart

## What is this about?

This is a start project which contains a basic folder structure + JUnit 4.12 dependency.

## Where should I write my code?

* Test code must be created under `src/test/java`.
* Production code must be placed under `src/main/java`.

## How can I check the results of my tests?

After you run the command `gradle test`, a report will be created under `build/reports/tests/test/`. All you need to do is open the *index.html* file on your favorite web browser and see in details the results of your test set.

# Tasks
gradle *test* - compile both production and test codes, then run the tests and create the test report

* **For a full available tasks, run `gradle tasks`**
